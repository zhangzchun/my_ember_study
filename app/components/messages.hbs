            Hey Zoey, have you had a chance to look at the EmberConf
            brainstorming doc I sent you?

        <p>Hey!</p>

        <p>
            I love the ideas! I'm really excited about where this year's
            EmberConf is going, I'm sure it's going to be the best one yet.
            Some quick notes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Definitely agree that we should double the coffee budget this
                year (it really is impressive how much we go through!)
            </li>
            <li>
                A blimp would definitely make the venue very easy to find, but
                I think it might be a bit out of our budget. Maybe we could
                rent some spotlights instead?
            </li>
            <li>
                We absolutely will need more hamster wheels, last year's line
                was <em>way</em> too long. Will get on that now before rental
                season hits its peak.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let me know when you've nailed down the dates!</p>
